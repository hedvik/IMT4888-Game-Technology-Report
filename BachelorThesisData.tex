Unity's new entity-component-system is currently in early preview with the promise of ''performance by default'' using a data-oriented workflow. In order to see how large the performance differences were, I measured the performance of three different test conditions which simulated an animated galaxy. The results show that Unity ECS combined with the new Job System and Burst Compiler could run an animated galaxy with 100 000 star meshes at an average framerate of 72. The best optimised standard Unity case on the other hand achieved similar a framerate, but with 10 000 star meshes instead.
